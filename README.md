# Recipe Finder Mini-Project

## Project Overview
The Recipe Finder is a web application designed to allow users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have at hand. It serves as a practical exercise to reinforce HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, focusing on DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Objective

- Input ingredients to search for recipes.
- View a list of recipes that include those ingredients.
- See detailed information about each recipe when selected.

## Tools and Technologies
- **HTML**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## Features
- **Ingredient Search Input**: Users can type in ingredients they wish to cook with, and the application will display recipes that use these ingredients.
- **Recipe List Display**: Shows recipes that match the search criteria.
- **Recipe Details**: Users can click on a recipe to view more detailed cooking instructions and ingredient lists.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage
